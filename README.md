# Bradfield CS Software Systems Behind the Abstractions 2022 Course

This repository will hold the work that I am doing in this course: https://my.bradfieldcs.com/ssba/2022-01/.

This includes source code, diagrams, and notes that I take from this course.

The files will be organized per week with a main map diagram that will be added to as more information is covered throughout the course.
